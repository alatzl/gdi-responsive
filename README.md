## Course description

Responsive design is awesome, but for practical reasons, we can't always afford to re-build a website from scratch when we decide it's time for a site to be responsive. In this workshop, we'll take a look at techniques for taking existing fixed-width sites and making them responsive.

This workshop will provide a basic understanding of responsive design, from concept to code, and give you the tools and resources for taking an existing site and making it a responsive one. We'll cover media queries, design tools and best practices, and we'll have some hands-on coding time for getting practice making it all work.


### Prerequisites:

Attendees should be comfortable with HTML and CSS. Specifically, you should understand the CSS box model, floats, CSS resets and HTML standards and tags.


### Tech requirements:

 - Please bring a laptop* and charger to class. Power outlets and wifi will be provided.
 - You may also wish to bring a notepad and pen/pencil for taking notes.
 - You'll also need a modern browser and your favorite text editor installed. We recommend Sublime Text and Google Chrome.
